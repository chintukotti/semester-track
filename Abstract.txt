Problem Statement
College Days: Academic Semester Management System
Problem
College and university students often struggle to effectively manage their academic schedules, track semester progress, and organize their study plans. Traditional methods like paper calendars or basic digital calendars lack the specialized features needed for academic planning, such as tracking class days, holidays, exams, and events within a semester. Students need a dedicated tool that allows them to visualize their entire semester at a glance, mark important dates, and track their progress through the academic term.

Current Challenges
Lack of Specialized Tools: Most calendar applications are designed for general use and don't cater to the specific needs of academic planning.
Difficulty Tracking Progress: Students struggle to visualize their progress through a semester and understand how many days have passed versus how many remain.
Inefficient Organization: Managing multiple semesters, tracking different types of academic days (classes, holidays, exams, events), and maintaining this information over time is challenging.
Limited Accessibility: Students need access to their academic schedule across multiple devices, with the ability to update information in real-time.
No Integration with Academic Workflow: Existing tools don't integrate well with the specific workflow of academic planning and progress tracking.
